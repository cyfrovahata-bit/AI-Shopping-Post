# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Postly** (product/domain name `postly.pp.ua`; package name is still `ai-shopping-post`) — a multi-tenant SaaS
where sellers upload product photos, AI generates per-platform post text, and the app publishes to Telegram,
Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Shafa.ua, Prom.ua, OLX, Rozetka and Kasta.ua. Deployed on Railway.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev             # Run the server (tsx, no separate build step needed for local dev)
npm start                # Same as dev — both just run tsx src/server.ts
npm run build            # Rebuilds sqlite3 native bindings + `tsc --noEmit` (type-check only, no JS is emitted/run from it)
npx tsc --noEmit -p .    # Type-check only, fastest way to verify a change compiles
```

There is no test runner/framework configured. `scripts/` contains ad-hoc `tsx` debug scripts used while
building the Shafa Playwright integration (e.g. `npm run test:shafa`, `npm run inspect:shafa`, and various
`scripts/check-*.ts` one-offs) — these are manual diagnostic tools, not an automated suite.

Production runs via the `Dockerfile` (Node 22 + ffmpeg + fonts-dejavu-core) on Railway.

## Architecture

### Request flow
`public/*.html` (no build step — plain HTML/CSS/JS served via `express.static`) → Express routes in
`src/server.ts` → per-platform modules → SQLite (`src/db/sqlite.ts`).

- `public/index.html` — public marketing landing page. Client-side redirects to `/app.html` if a JWT is
  already in `localStorage`.
- `public/app.html` (+ `public/app.js`) — the authenticated product-creation cabinet (upload photo/video,
  generate text, pick platforms, publish).
- `public/setup.html` — per-user platform connection/settings page (all OAuth/token flows and category pickers
  live here).
- `public/products.html` (+ `public/products.js`) — post history/list.
- `public/stats.html`, `public/login.html` — self-explanatory; inline `<script>` per page, no shared JS bundle.
- Auth-gated pages all follow the same pattern: check `localStorage.getItem('authToken')` client-side and
  redirect to `/login.html` if missing, then send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every API call.

### Multi-tenancy & auth (`src/auth.ts`, `src/user-tokens.ts`)
- JWT-based auth (`signToken`/`verifyToken`, 30-day expiry). `authMiddleware` + `requireExistingUser` are
  combined as `requireUser` in `server.ts` and spread (`...requireUser`) onto every per-user route.
  `currentUserId(req)` reads the numeric user id middleware attaches to `req`.
  `EVERY` per-user API route needs `...requireUser` — a route only reachable with a valid Postly session token.
- OAuth `state` params (Facebook/TikTok/OLX) are signed short-lived JWTs via `signOAuthState`/`verifyOAuthState`
  (15 min expiry) — never revert to unsigned base64 state; that lets an attacker bind their own social account
  to someone else's Postly user by crafting the authorize URL directly.
- Per-user social credentials live in `user_social_tokens` (one row per user+platform), encrypted at rest
  (`user-tokens.ts`: AES-256-GCM, key derived from `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`/`JWT_SECRET`). Read via
  `getUserTokens(db, userId)` / `getUserSocialStatus(db, userId)`, write via `saveUserToken(db, userId, platform, data)`.
- **One external account → one Postly user** is enforced at the DB level via partial unique indexes in
  `sqlite.ts` (`ensureUniqueIndex`, tolerant of pre-existing duplicate rows so it never crashes startup).
  Platforms with a dedicated column (`page_id`, `instagram_user_id`, `open_id`, `user_settings.telegram_chat_id`)
  use that column directly; everything else (Prom, OLX, Rozetka, Kasta, Shafa) uses the generic
  `external_account_id` column — a hash of the token for platforms with static tokens (`hashForIdentity()`),
  or a real fetched account id for platforms whose tokens rotate (OLX), or a scraped username (Shafa, which has
  no real API). `saveUserToken` translates the resulting `UNIQUE constraint failed` into a friendly Ukrainian
  message via `DUPLICATE_ACCOUNT_MESSAGES`/`DUPLICATE_PLATFORM_MESSAGES`.

### Platform registry (`src/platforms/index.ts`, `src/platform-types.ts`)
Every publishing target implements `PublishingPlatform` (`generatePrompt(product)` + `publish(params)`).
`platforms: Record<PlatformId, PublishingPlatform>` is the single registry; `getPlatform(id)` /
`isPlatformId()` / `enabledPlatformIds` are the only things callers (server routes, scheduler) touch —
add a new platform by adding one entry here, not by scattering platform checks elsewhere.

**To add a new platform**, follow the pattern of the most recently added one (currently `kasta`, see
`src/kasta.ts` + its wiring in `platforms/index.ts`, `user-tokens.ts`, `server.ts`, `setup.html`, `app.html`):
1. `src/<platform>.ts` — `xTestConnection`, `publishXPost({product,text,photoPaths,imageUrls,extras,creds})`,
   and (if it has categories/attributes) a search + best-effort characteristic-matching helper, mirroring
   `rozetka.ts`'s `buildRozetkaParams` (only auto-fills what we already collect — color/size/material — and
   fails loudly with a clear message instead of guessing at fields we have no data for).
2. Add the id to `PlatformId` in `platform-types.ts`.
3. Add `<Platform>Creds` + a branch in `getUserTokens`/`getUserSocialStatus`/`DUPLICATE_*_MESSAGES` in
   `user-tokens.ts`.
4. Add the platform entry + `generatePrompt` (a JSON-output prompt if the platform needs structured fields
   like colors/sizes/brand) to `platforms/index.ts`, and to `enabledPlatformIds`.
5. Add `/api/<platform>/status|save|verify|categories|set-default-category` routes to `server.ts` (copy the
   Rozetka block — it's the fullest example) and add the platform key to the `platformKeys` array used for
   the stats "connected platforms" count.
6. Add a Setup tab (button + panel + JS) to `setup.html`, a checkbox to `app.html`, and an icon entry to
   `stats.html`'s `platformMeta` and `index.html`'s platform pills.
7. Generic `DELETE /api/user/social/:platform` and per-user token storage already work for any platform with
   no code changes needed there.

Platforms differ a lot in auth model — Facebook/TikTok/OLX use real OAuth (authorization code grant, one
shared dev app), Prom/Rozetka/Kasta use a personal token the seller pastes in themselves (no OAuth app at
all), Shafa has no real API and drives the actual site via a per-user Playwright session
(`src/shafa/`, `shafa.session.ts` persists the browser context so login doesn't repeat every publish).

### Publishing pipeline & scheduler (`src/scheduler.ts`)
- `platform_posts` rows move through `draft → scheduled → publishing → published/failed`.
- A background tick (`setInterval`, 45s) picks up due `scheduled` posts and publishes them; manual "publish
  now" goes through the same `publishPlatformPost()` function.
- Before doing any real publish work, `publishPlatformPost` atomically claims the row
  (`UPDATE ... SET status='publishing' WHERE id=? AND status NOT IN ('publishing','published')`, checking
  `result.changes`) — this is what prevents the same post being published twice if the scheduler tick and a
  manual click race, or a double-click happens. Don't remove this claim step when touching this file.
- `withRetry(fn, maxAttempts, baseDelayMs)` wraps flaky network calls with linear backoff.
- Token refresh (TikTok, OLX — both rotate access tokens) happens inline in the scheduler right before
  publish, persisted back via `saveUserToken`.

### Database (`src/db/sqlite.ts`)
- Single SQLite file. `DB_PATH` env var picks the path; on Railway it defaults to `/data/database.sqlite`
  when `/data` exists (the mounted persistent volume) so the DB survives redeploys — **the Railway volume's
  own Mount Path must be set to `/data` (the directory), not a nested file path**, or persistence silently
  breaks. Same reasoning applies to uploaded photos (`UPLOADS_DIR`, resolved in `server.ts`).
- Schema evolves via `ensureColumn(db, table, col, def)` (idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`) and
  `ensureUniqueIndex(db, name, sql)` (idempotent `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`, logs+continues instead of crashing
  startup if pre-existing data already violates it) — there are no numbered migration files, `initDb()` is
  the single source of truth and is safe to run against an existing populated DB every boot.
- Core tables: `users`, `user_social_tokens` (per-user platform credentials), `user_settings` (per-user
  Telegram chat id + shop branding), `products`, `product_images` (many-to-one), `platform_posts` (one row
  per product×platform).

### AI generation (`src/ai-generator.ts`)
Uses the OpenAI **Responses API** (`openai.responses.create()`, SDK v6+, `input_image`/`input_text` content
types — not the older Chat Completions shape). Model comes from `OPENAI_MODEL` env. Each platform's
`generatePrompt(product)` in `platforms/index.ts` supplies the platform-specific instructions; several
platforms (Shafa, Prom, OLX, Rozetka, Kasta) require the model to return structured JSON (parsed back out
of the generated text before publish) rather than plain post copy.

### Video overlay (`src/video-overlay.ts`)
ffmpeg/ffprobe-based Reels-style text overlay. Styles: `minimal`, `fashion` (default), `premium`, `sale`.
Requires `-pix_fmt yuv420p` (Instagram rejects video without it) and avoids emoji in `drawtext` (ffmpeg can't
render them without an emoji font) — uses `fonts/Arial-Bold.ttf` bundled in the repo, with a `HAS_FONT`
existence check and graceful fallback if it's ever missing.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the baseline (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`,
`ORDER_URL`, `INSTAGRAM_USER_ID`, `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SITE_URL`, `PORT`) — these are mostly legacy
single-tenant fallbacks/shared-app config now that credentials are per-user. Also relevant:
`JWT_SECRET`, `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (must be real random secrets in production — they protect session
tokens and encrypted per-user social credentials), `DB_PATH`, `UPLOADS_DIR`, `FACEBOOK_APP_ID/APP_SECRET`,
`TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY/CLIENT_SECRET`, `OLX_CLIENT_ID/CLIENT_SECRET` (shared OAuth app credentials —
Prom/Rozetka/Kasta need no app-level secret since sellers paste in their own personal tokens).
